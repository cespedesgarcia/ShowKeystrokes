# ShowKeystrokes
Shows your keyboard\mouse keystrokes on screen minimalistically 

The script displays the keys only when you physically press them and stops displaying them when you release the keys.

Exceptions feature lets you "Add the words (to the script) which are first characters of your password, so when you start typing your password, script will pause for 5 sec."
